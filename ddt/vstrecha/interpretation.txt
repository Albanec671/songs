Encounter

I was holding his hand, I was by his side,
When the first snow was dying out in the yard.

When the blind black smoke crawled out on the roofs,
When dark matter of a human was cooling down.

I will die without love, don't be silent, say something.
Whispering cages and rustling steps by the door
Transparent flame of a candle is barely breathing,
Would you tell me the meanings of war, don't be silent.

A fiery face is swaying slightly.
Sounds, smells, wind and light are his flesh.
God's eternal messenger, a greybeard infant.
"I am tired" — he replied — "Sadly, there is no time".

It's a pity that crows won't peck out my body,
It won't ressurect then beneath the alder in the yard,
Sadly, I am not destined for freedom to love or die
The meanings of all wars are hidden within all games.

Angel embraced me with the warm vermillion wing
The heavens' heaven flashed for an instant 
Choose... — he smiled, sighed and disappeared,
And then it got dark... 

Then it dawned...
