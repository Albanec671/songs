The song is quite infamous nowdays especially for being the symbol of protest.
It has been sang at many anti-government rallies in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus alone. 
The most common interpretation of contents of this song is desire for a political
change here in the post-soviet space especially.

Funny enough according to Tsoi himself (and many from his circle) originally
the song wasn't about political changes but about something much deeper, 
changes within oneself. Despite that when released in 1989 it became an 
unofficial anthem of Perestroika â€” a political movement for reformation 
within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the 1980s.
