A song about a fallen pilot

Through the whole war to the brim, I longed for home
Despite being hot-headed, fought solidly.
While he was hasty, once didn't duck¹, — 
And two years of war turned around into nothing at all!

His pulse can't be heard since the 43rd spring,
And I dived into the pre-war dreams.
Going dizzy, I see, but my breath is heavy...
He was simpler and kinder,
Kinder, well... and I was lucky.

I didn't live in the bossom, didn't have tea with god,
Didn't strive for the rear², nor under the fate's dress
But still women silently hinted to me, when encountered:
"If you stayed there forever, maybe mine would come back."

Their sorrowful question is no mystery to me — 
I am also sorry their wishes didn't come true
An answer came to me: "Excuse my being alive!
I accidentally came back,
Well and yours... didn't make it".

While burning in the airplane, he screamed in the end:
— Just you live, you'll make it! — I could hear through hum.
We were flying beneath god, near the very paradise — 
He rose up a little bit and landed there, and I... well, I made it to the ground.

Heavenly aerodrome met the pilot dryly.
He landed on belly, but wasn't grovelling on it,
He fell asleep — not to wake up, started singing — not to finish,
Well and I... I came back,
And he didn't make it.

I am deeply and eternally guilty before those,
To meet whome, today I would consider an honour.
And even though we made it out alive,
The memories burn us and conscience torments those, who have one.

Someone grudgingly and neatly alloted the hours
Of our life, short like the concrete strip³.
Some crashed into it, and some took off forever...
Well and I... I landed — that's the problem.
That's the problem.
