Everything is going as planned

Border key is broken in two.
Our Father Lenin has completely deceased.
He decomposed into mold and linden honey.
Perestroika keeps going and going on as planned.
All the dirt has turned into bare ice.
Everything is going as planned.

My fate wanted to go retire.
I promised it not to take part in the war game.
But there is a hammer and sickle and a star on my cap.
How touching it is — a hammer and sickle and a star!
Dashing lantern of wait is dangling about. 
Everything is going as planned.

They fed my wife to the crowd.
Trampled her chest with the world fist.
Teared down her flesh with the nationwide freedom.
So bury her in Christ!
Everything is going as planned.

Only the grandpa Lenin was a really good chief,
And all the others, the rest — such shit!
And all the others are enemies and such trash!
Raging snow was falling upon the dear homeland.
I bought a "Korea" magazine — all good there too.
Comrade Kim Il-sung is there, they're the same as us.
I am sure they are exactly the same.
Everything is going as planned.

And when communism comes everything will be fucking great.
It will come soon — we just gotta wait.
Everything will be for free, all's gonna be fun. 
I guess people won't have to die there at all.
I woke up in the night and realized that
Everything is going as planned.
