            <div class="p-right">Border key is broken in two.
Our Father Lenin has completely deceased.
He decomposed into mold and linden honey.
Perestroika keeps going and going on as planned.
All the dirt has turned into bare ice.
Everything is going as planned.

My fate wanted to go retire.
I promised it not to take part in the war game.
But there is a hammer and sickle and a star on my cap.
How touching it is ‚Äî a hammer and sickle and a star!
Dashing lantern of wait is dangling about. 
Everything is going as planned.

They fed my wife to the crowd.
Trampled her chest with the world fist.
Teared down her flesh with the nationwide freedom.
So bury her in Christ!
Everything is going as planned.

Only the grandpa Lenin was a really good chief,
And all the others, the rest ‚Äî such shit!
And all the others are enemies and such trash!
Raging snow was falling upon the dear homeland.
I bought a "Korea" magazine ‚Äî all good there too.
Comrade Kim Il-sung is there, they're the same as us.
I am sure they are exactly the same.
Everything is going as planned.

And when communism comes everything will be fucking great.
It will come soon ‚Äî we just gotta wait.
Everything will be for free, all's gonna be fun. 
I guess people won't have to die there at all.
I woke up in the night and realized that
Everything is going as planned.

          <h2>–°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∞ - Details</h2>
          <p>Yegor Letov recollected that he wanted to write a song as if he was a 
¬´simple soviet¬ª ¬´drunken tired man, that has sunken low completely, his wife 
left him, something else...¬ª.

The song is supposed to represent a stream of consciousness ‚Äî what this person 
sees while drinking and watching the central TV station news programme and what 
he thinks at that moment. Letov himself turned on his TV and started writing down
everything he saw as if he was that person. It resulted in about 20 verses, of which
he picked the most interesting ones.

The song was first recorded in 1988 in Omsk.

"Everything is going as planned" could be a reference to the Five-Year plans
developed by the soviet state planning committee Gosplan or in a bigger, 
religious sense i.e. the plan of salvation.

"People won't have to die there at all." could be a reference to a phrase from the
Chapaev film ‚Äî a fictionalized biography of Vasily Ivanovich Chapaev (1887‚Äì1919),
a Red Army commander who became a hero of the Russian Civil War.
