The New Patriotic
 
Ah, the roads, dust and fog,
Colds, anxieties and the steppe weed
Enemies of the proletariat dictatorship are fucked!
And even if the bullet misses, bayonet won't!
Those who note a lot will have their eyes poked out
And those who's in our way we put up against the wall!

Since we take this blazing road to communism!
As we take this blazing road to communism!

We are of one and only materialistic nature
Religion is the evil opium of our people
And the "immortal soul" is a malicious fucking atavism 
We'll crucify Christ anew, go atheism!
The laws of our world shall be right and simple
We'll wrap the earth with heavens of our might!

Since we take this blazing road to communism!
As we take this blazing road to communism!

Almaty and the events in Poland don't scare us
Since the heroic patriots keep coming everyday
And for the seasoned contr-revolutionary like Lech Walesa
We'll open Buchenwald and Auschwitz anew
To conduct experiments on anarchists and whatnot
For everything we've got them STEEL MAN arguments!

Since we take this blazing road to communism!
As we take this blazing road to communism!
