Great and Eternal

Projector of perestroika highlights perestroika,
The builder of communism adores communism,
KGB staff approves of KGB,
Any right bullet loves it's machine gun.

Party — mind, honour and conscience of the era!
                         Great and eternal!
                         Great and eternal!

Concrete freedom reigns in cast iron cities,
In brave minds posters are in charge,
Intertia rules over obedient bodies,
And we're no more, we're no more, WE ARE NO MORE!

Party — mind, honour and conscience of the era!
                         Great and eternal!
                         Great and eternal!

State anthems thundered generously,
Uncensored books quetly burned out,
Triumphal fireworks rang out over the world,
Annihilated louse snapped under the nail!

Party — mind, honour and conscience of the era!
                         Great and eternal!
                         Great and eternal!

Spring promises to be lengthy,
Arable land is expecting the best grain,
And we live on the good land,
But we're no more, we're no more, WE ARE NO MORE!

Party — mind, honour and conscience of the era!
                         Great and eternal!
                         Great and eternal!
