Leningrad

Plus one, zero, plus two, the Winter turned black!
January sky ulcer is blooming, ha-ha!
South wind has crawled here, unable to run,
The deadhead is devouring oversalted snow.
And following him like plague — the Spring!
Oh-ha-ha-ha!

A flock of boots has flown over Nevsky 
There is such a mess over Nevsky,
And the jail is watching over Nevsky through a peephole
Full of lonesome men,
Who haven't found the reasons of gifting warmth.

Quite unclear she is — the Spring!
Eh-ha-ha-ha!

And the water in canals reflects bridges
And cliffs of palaces and forests of pillars
And stacks of domes, and the chicken coop kiosk,
Handing out bunches of dried roses for free.
And the Culture, sweating in the cellophane of rains,
Declares the White Knives Nights for all
And we're all scared of the approaching war...

She's the guilty one — the Spring!
Oh-ha-ha-ha!

Hey, Leningrad, Petersburg, Petrograd,
Pasture of Mars, Winter graveyard.
Offspring of Russia, unlike his mother —
Pale, thin, euro-eyed passer-by.
Herr Leningrad, stocked over the top.
Fried, steamed, gifted, stolen.
Monsieur Leningrad, tagged by the revolution,
The furniture scorcher, overcrippled house.
With windows, dibs, lions, titans,
Lindens, sphinxes, copper, Auroras.
Sir Leningrad, you're spoiled by warmth,
You're kissed all over already in January
By the greedy Spring. Your revelations to her
Cut open my veins of sorrow and doubt.
Pan Leningrad, I have hopelessly fallen in love 
With Your steel eyes...

Pour me till I'm drunk — the Spring!
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
