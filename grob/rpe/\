Russian experiments field

To torture one's flesh with a touching little knife
To torture one's flesh with a touching little knife
To pinch the willing fingers till they bleed 
Bravely savoring the lollipops
Deliberately stuffing the pockets
With dead mice and lively dicks
With chocolate sweets 
And miraculous beatings
At the patriarchical dump of obsolete concepts,
Utilized forms and courteous words
Destroy the whole world by ending yourself
DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD BY ENDING YOURSELF

...eternity smells of crude oil*
...eternity smells of crude oil

Frost-like compassionate laughter
Frost-like compassionate laughter
Frost-like compassionate laughter
Is gloriously falling* onto...
onto...
Onto the RUSSIAN FIELD OF EXPERIMENTS

Geography of vileness
Orphography of hatred
Apologia of ignorance
Mythology of optimism
Laws of the virtuous howitzer*
Noble feast of prudence
Out of the mouths of babes* speaks the hole 
Out of the mouths of babes speaks the bullet

...eternity smells of crude oil
...eternity smells of crude oil

The craftsmanship of being excessive like me,
The craftsmanship of being loved like fate,
The craftsmanship of being global like baked apple,
The art of going aside on time
The art of being a stranger
The art of becoming a stranger*
The state of the art oven remedy 
From the voluntarily suffocated
The state of the art rope remedy
From the nasty smell of unwashed necks
The state of the art remedy to find the guilty*
The state of the art remedy to find the guilty 

RUSSIAN FIELD OF EXPERIMENTS

Emptiness behind the opened door
That means, someone has come for you
That means, that now someone needs you

Ans the snow keeps going and going,
Russian field exudes snow*

Some were buried in a pack of eyes 
Some were buried in a pack of newspapers

As for the bull, put to death at massacre,
Tis the subject of everyone's joy, everyone's pride
Everyone's hatred, everyone's will
Everyone's will and everyone's old age

To stuff the grave with oneself to capacity,
Means to inherit the land.
What is inheriting the land then?
That means to run out of patience.
Quod erat demonstrandum!

Into the peephole — into the key slot,
Cute genious thoughts — cute world wars
Unofficial navels of the earth*
Enameled parts of head systems
Instinctive volunteers
In the name of the universe and bread crust
People with a capital "P",
You spell the word «People» with a capital "P"!

Swastika of faith pulled off the faces
Babylonian alphabet stuck to the fingers
Historically justified method of 
Devouring the raw earth
Isn't that what we need?!
Isn't that what we need?!

Adn in the morning they inevitably woke up
Didn't catch cold — didn't get dirty
