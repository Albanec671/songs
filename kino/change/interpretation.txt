Change

In place of warmth — fields of glass
In place of fire — smoke,
A day is snatched out of the calendar grid.
Red sun is burning to ashes,
The day is burning out with it
A shadow falls upon the blazing city.

Change is longed for by our hearts,
Change is longed for by our eyes,
In our laughter, in our tears and in the pulsation of veins —
Change! We await change!

Electric light lengthens our day
And the match box is empty,
But a blue flower of gas is burning in the kitchen.
Cigarettes in hand, tea on the table — the setup is simple.
And nothing else — everything is within us.

We don't have eyes of wisdom
Or skillful hand gestures to show off,
We don't need all that to get each other.
Cigarettes in hand, tea on the table — thus the circle ends.
And suddenly we are scared to change something.
