Yegor Letov recollected that he wanted to write a song as if he was a 
«simple soviet» «drunken tired man, that has sunken low completely, his wife 
left him, something else...».

The song is supposed to represent a stream of consciousness — what this person 
sees while drinking and watching the central TV station news programme and what 
he thinks at that moment. Letov himself turned on his TV and started writing down
everything he saw as if he was that person. It resulted in about 20 verses, of which
he picked the most interesting ones.

The song was first recorded in 1988 in Omsk.

"Everything is going as planned" could be a reference to the Five-Year plans
developed by the soviet state planning committee Gosplan or in a bigger, 
religious sense i.e. the plan of salvation.

"People won't have to die there at all." could be a reference to a phrase from the
Chapaev film — a fictionalized biography of Vasily Ivanovich Chapaev (1887–1919),
a Red Army commander who became a hero of the Russian Civil War.
