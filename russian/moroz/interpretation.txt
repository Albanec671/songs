Oh dear frost...

Oh dear frost,
Don't you freeze me,
Don't you freeze me nor my horse.

Don't you freeze me nor my horse
My white-maned horse.

My white-maned horse.
My wife is of the jealous kind.

My wife is such a beauty,
Expecting me home, saddened by wait.

I'll return home at sunset,
Hug my wife, water my horse.

Oh dear frost,
Don't you freeze me,
Don't you freeze me nor my horse.
