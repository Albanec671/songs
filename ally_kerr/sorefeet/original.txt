The sore feet song

I walk ten thousand miles,
Ten thousand miles, to see you.
And every gasp of breath — I grabbed it just to find you.
I climbed up every hill to get to you.
I wandered ancient lands to hold just you...

And every single step of the way — I pay.
Every single night and day I searched for you.
Through sandstorms and hazy dawns
I reached for you...

I stole ten thousand pounds,
Ten thousand pounds to see you
I robbed convenience stores
'Cause I thought they'd make it easier
I lived of rats and toads and I starved for you
I fought of giant bears and I killed them too.

And every single step of the way — I pay.
Every single night and day I searched for you.
Through sandstorms and hazy dawns
I reached for you...

I'm tired and I'm weak, but I'm strong for you.
I wanna go home but my love gets me through...
