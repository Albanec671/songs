Boys were dying

Some boys died a horrible death. 
Some boys died a simple death,
And not everyone was beautiful on the outside,
And not everyone was of great height. 

But when these dusty human eyes
Looked at me 
Not like birds, not like animals,
They warmed me humanly.

And I played them my rock-n-roll songs,
I kept saying: "It's going to be okay".
And I chanted: "We're all together!",
It just sounded somewhat... trivial.

Closer to death people are purer,
Further back in the rear generals are fatter.
Here I saw what might happen
To Moscow, Ukraine and Ural.

Eighteen yearsÂ is not much,
When you wonder Tverskaya broke.
And not much when the heart has stopped,
While the country gifts you a plastic bunch.

And the country plays them rock-n-roll songs,
It keeps saying: "It's going to be okay".
The country chants: "We're all together!",
It just sounds somewhat... trivial.

Some boys died a simple death,
Some boys died a horrible death. 
And not everyone was beautiful on the outside,
And not everyone was of great height.
