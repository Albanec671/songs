Don't you hurry

Well don't you hurry to bury us, 
Still got some business around here,
Got little kids at home waiting,
And just wanted to live on for a little longer.

Well don't you hurry to shoot us in the back,
That sort of thing is never too late,
Better let us finish off dancing,
Better let us finish off singing that song.

Well don't you hurry to shut our eyes,
We all like darkness anyway,
And the vine is whipping our cheeks,
Getting excited for the bare skin.

Well don't you hurry not to love us,
Don't you count the victories by days,
If me and you don't live through today,
Who's gonna love you tomorrow?
