Tis not evening yet

Tis not evening yet, it is not.
Little did I sleep last night
Little did I sleep last night
In my dream I had a vision...

In my dream I had a vision,
As if my raven horse,
Had been playing and running around,
Frolicking under me.

And then the evil winds arrived,
From the eastern side they did,
Ripped off the black hat,
From my reckless head.

The yesaulÂ¹ was of the smart kind,
He could interpret my dream.
He told me: "That reckless head of yours,
Shall surely come off" 

Tis not evening yet, it is not.
Little did I sleep last night
Little did I sleep last night
In my dream I had a vision...
