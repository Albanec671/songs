Captain Kolesnikov

Who's gonna tell us a couple of honest words on death?
It's a pity the fallen sailors don't have black boxes
The pencil is breaking, it's dark and cold
Captain Kolesnikov is writing us a note

We are but a few on this sea bottom of hunger
Three compartments have blown up and three are still blazing
I know we're doomed, but if you have faith — wait for me
You'll find this letter of mine on your chest

«Kursk» shook abruptly and stopped dead,
Cut the ropes of rusty veins and farewelled.
The overcast sea sky, seagulls, ships
A submarine sleeps on the ground, but so far from the land!

Long after all this they will keep telling lies 
Will the comission tell, how hard it is to die?
Who of us are equal, who's a hero and who's a jerk
Captain Kolesnikov is writing us a note
