            <div class="p-left">Трогательным ножичком пытать свою плоть
Трогательным ножичком пытать свою плоть
До крови прищемить добровольные пальцы
Отважно смакуя леденцы на палочке
Целеустремлённо набивать карманы
Мёртвыми мышатами, живыми хуями
Шоколадными конфетами 
И нерукотворными пиздюлями
На патриархальной свалке устаревших понятий
Использованных образов и вежливых слов
Покончив с собою, уничтожить весь мир
ПОКОНЧИВ С СОБОЮ, УНИЧТОЖИТЬ ВЕСЬ МИР!!

Мастерство быть глобальным, как печёное яблоко
Искусство вовремя уйти в сторонку
   Искусство быть посторонним

За открывшейся дверью — пустота
Это значит, что кто-то пришёл за тобой
Это значит, что теперь ты кому-то понадобился

А снег всё идёт, а снег всё идёт
Русское поле источает снег

Иных хоронили в упаковке глазёнок
Иных хоронили в упаковке газет

А то, что на бойне умертвили бычка 
На то всеобщая радость, всеобщая гордость
Всеобщая ненависть, всеобщая воля
Всеобщая воля да всеобщая старость

Набить до отказа собой могилу, 
Это значит наследовать землю.
Что же такое наследовать землю?
Это значит исчерпать терпение.
Что и требовалось доказать!

В дверной глазок — в замочную щель 
Гениальные мыслишки — мировые войнушки
Неофициальные пупы земли
Эмалированные части головных систем
Инстинктивные добровольцы
Во имя вселенной и хлебной корочки
Люди с большой буквы
Слово «люди» пишется с большой буквы

Свастика веры стянула лица
Вавилонская азбука налипла на пальцах
Исторически оправданный метод
Пожирания сырой земли
   Это ли не то, что нам надо?!
   Это ли не то, что нам надо?!

А поутру они неизбежно проснулись
Не простудились — не замарались
Называли вещи своими именами
Сеяли доброе, разумное, вечное
Всё посеяли, всё назвали
Кушать подано — честь по чести
На первое были плоды просвещения
А на второе — кровавые мальчики

Орденоносный господь победоносного мира
Заслуженный господь краснознамённого страха
Праведный праздник для правильных граждан
Отточенный серп для созревших колосьев

Яма как принцип движения к Солнцу
Кашу слезами не испортишь нет

Полные сани девичьим срамом
Полные простыни ребячьим смрадом
Девичьи глазки, кукушкины слёзки
А так же всякие иные предметы

Так кто погиб в генеральном сраженьи
Кто погиб в гениальном поражении
За полную чашку жалости
В Сталинградской битве озверевшей похоти?

Самолёт усмехнулся вдребезги
В бугорок обетованной земли
Самолёт усмехнулся вдребезги
В бугорок обетованной землицы

А свою любовь я собственноручно
Освободил от дальнейших неизбежных огорчений
Подманил ее пряником
Подманил ее пряником
Изнасиловал пьяным жестоким ботинком
И повесил на облачке, словно ребёнок
        СВОЮ НЕЛЮБИМУЮ КУКЛУ
        СВОЮ НЕЛЮБИМУЮ КУКЛУ
        СВОЮ НЕЛЮБИМУЮ КУКЛУ
        СВОЮ НЕЛЮБИМУЮ КУКЛУ

Словно иней, сердобольный смех 
Словно иней, сердобольный смех 
Словно иней, сердобольный смех

The craftsmanship of being as excessive as me,
The craftsmanship of being as loved as a noose,
The craftsmanship of being as global as a baked apple,
The art of stepping aside on time
The art of being a stranger
The art of becoming a stranger⁴
The state of the art remedy to rid ovens
From the voluntarily suffocated
The state of the art remedy to rid ropes
From the nasty smell of unwashed necks
The state of the art remedy to find the guilty⁵
The state of the art remedy to find the guilty 

RUSSIAN EXPERIMENTS FIELD

Emptiness behind the opened door
That means, someone has come for you
That means, that now someone needs you

And the snow keeps falling and falling
Russian field exudes snow⁶

Some were buried in a pack of eyes 
Some were buried in a pack of newspapers

As for the bull, put to death at massacre,
Tis the subject of everyone's joy, everyone's pride
Everyone's hatred, everyone's will
Everyone's will and everyone's old age

To stuff the grave with oneself to capacity,
Means to inherit the earth.
What is inheriting the earth then?
It is to run out of patience¹⁴.
Quod erat demonstrandum!

Into the peephole — into the key slot,
Cute genious thoughts — cute world wars
Unofficial navels of the earth⁷
Enameled parts of head systems
Instinctive volunteers
In the name of the universe and bread crust
People with a capital "P",
You spell the word «People» with a capital "P"!

Swastika of faith pulled off the faces
Babylonian alphabet stuck to the fingers
Historically justified method of 
Devouring the raw earth
Isn't that what we need?!
Isn't that what we need?!

And in the morning they inevitably woke up
Didn't catch cold — didn't get dirty
Called a spade a spade,
Sowed the good, the reasonable, the eternal¹³.
Now they sowed everything and named everything.
Dinner is served — fair and square¹¹
The first course were fruits of enlightenment
And for the second they had bloody boys¹²

Order-bearing⁸ Lord of the victorious world,
Well-earned Lord of the red banner fear
A righteous feast for the right citizens
A sharpened sickle for the ripe ears⁹

Pit as the principle of movement towards the Sun
Plenty of tears is no plague¹⁰

Sleigh full of maidenish disgrace
Sheets full of childish stench
Maidenish eyes, cuckoo tears
And also all sorts of other things

So who died in the general battle,
Who died in the brilliant defeat?
For the cup, full of pity
In the Stalingrad battle of beastly lust?

The airplane smirked to smithereens
Into the hillock of the promised land
The airplane smirked to smithereens
Into the hillock of the promised land

As for my love, I single-handedly
Freed it from further inevitable disappointment
Lured it with gingerbread!
Lured it with gingerbread!!!
Raped with a drunken cruel boot
And hanged it on a cloud, as a child hangs
ITS UNLOVED DOLL 
ITS UNLOVED DOLL 
ITS UNLOVED DOLL 
ITS UNLOVED DOLL 

Frost-like compassionate laughter
Frost-like compassionate laughter

          <h2>Справка - Details</h2>
          <p>[1] «Eternity smells of petroleum» could be a reference to William James works 
mentioned by Bertrand Russel: “William James describes a man who got the 
experience from laughing-gas; whenever he was under its influence, he knew the 
secret of the universe, but when he came to, he had forgotten it. At last, with 
immense effort, he wrote down the secret before the vision had faded. 
When completely recovered, he rushed to see what he had written. 
It was: "A smell of petroleum prevails throughout.”

Here Letov could be linking together this quote with the nature of petroleum, 
whereby the oil forms from the bodies of dead animals and plants over long 
periods of time. A more immediate association is the dependence of 
modern super-powers (like Russia itself) economies on the petroleum industry.

[2] Howitzer is generally a large ranged weapon that stands between an artillery gun and a mortar.

[3] «Out of the mouths of babes» is a common idiom (both in English and Russian)
that is typically used when a child says something surprisingly wise. It originates from 
the King James Bible, Psalms 8:2O: «Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.»

[4] Here Letov is most probably referring to the novel "Stranger" by Albert Camus 

[5] This is in reference to the Great Terror of 1937 conducted by Joseph Stalin, a campaign of 
political repression in the Soviet Union that occurred from 1936 to 1938. It involved large-scale 
repression of the peasantry; ethnic cleansing; purges of the Communist Party, government officials, 
and the Red Army; widespread police surveillance, suspicion of saboteurs and counter-revolutionaries, 
imprisonment, and arbitrary executions. Historians estimate the total number of deaths due to Stalinist
repression in 1937–38 to be between 950,000 and 1.2 million.

[6]

[7] The Omphalos of Delphi (Navel of the Earth) is an ancient marble monument that was found at the 
archaeological site of Delphi, Greece. It represented a stone thrown by the god Zeus, and marked the 
center of the world to the Ancient Greeks. In russian it is a common saying (often moking) meaning a 
person of great importance.

[8] Here order «орден» means a visible honour awarded by a sovereign state, monarch, dynastic royal 
house or organisation to a person, typically in recognition of individual merit, that often comes with
distinctive insignia such as collars, medals, badges, and sashes worn by recipients. The word is 
typically associated with russian (pre-revolution) military merit tradition. 

[9] The association between a sickle and ears and the Soviet Union emblem here is quite obvious. 

Personally this reminds me of a legend from Ab Urbe Condita Libri (History of Rome) by Titus Livius 
(64 BC – 12 AD) of the tyrannical Roman king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (Book 1, Chapter 54). 
He is said to have received a messenger from his son Sextus Tarquinius asking what he should do next 
in Gabii, since he had become all-powerful there. Rather than answering the messenger verbally, Tarquin
went into his garden, took a stick, and symbolically swept it across his garden, thus cutting off the 
heads of the tallest poppies that were growing there. The messenger, tired of waiting for an answer, 
returned to Gabii and told Sextus what he had seen. Sextus realised that his father wished him to put 
to death all of the most eminent people of Gabii, which he then did. So here I associate these lines 
with the repression of the Soviet Union government against the russian opposionist intelligentsia 
causing many to immigrate.

[10] The literal translation here is «One cannot spoil a porridge with tears» which is a play on a 
russian idiom «Кашу маслом не испортишь» — «One cannot spoil a porridge with butter». The meaning 
of the original idiom is basically that there can never be too much of something good. Here I tried to
find an equivalent english idiom and «Plenty is no plague» looks right. 

Here Letov is basically saying that there can never be too many tears for the «porridge». He could 
be implying that russian history in its entirety consists of events calling for tears to the point they
become a norm, like «butter in porridge».

[11] «Честь по чести» is a russian idiom equivalent to «Fair and square». 

[12] «кровавые мальчики» — «bloody boys» a direct reference to the "Boris Godunov" play 
by Alexander Pushkin:

                                  "И все тошнит, и голова кружится,
                                  И мальчики кровавые в глазах..."
                                                                      —
                                  "The sickness and dizziness all over,
                                  The sight of bloody boys in eyes..."

[13] A direct reference to the "To the sowers" poem by Nikolay Nekrasov:

                                  "Сейте разумное, доброе, вечное,
                                   Сейте! Спасибо вам скажет сердечное
                                   Русский народ..."
                                                                      —
                                  "Sow the reasonable, the good, the eternal,
                                   Sow! The russian folk will wholeheartedly 
                                   Thank you..."

[14] Directed at the Gospel of Matthew 5-5:
                                  
                              "Блаженны кроткие, ибо они наследуют землю."
                                                                                  —
                              "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth."

Here Letov is creating a contrast between being "meek" and "running out of patience"
