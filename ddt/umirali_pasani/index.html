            <div class="p-right">Some boys died a horrible death. 
Some boys died a simple death,
And not everyone was beautiful on the outside,
And not everyone was of great height. 

But when these dusty human eyes
Looked at me 
Not like birds, not like animals,
They warmed me humanly.

And I played them my rock-n-roll songs,
I kept saying: "It's going to be okay".
And I chanted: "We're all together!",
It just sounded somewhat... trivial.

Closer to death people are purer,
Further back in the rear generals are fatter.
Here I saw what might happen
To Moscow, Ukraine and Ural.

Eighteen years¬†is not much,
When you wonder Tverskaya broke.
And not much when the heart has stopped,
While the country gifts you a plastic bunch.

And the country plays them rock-n-roll songs,
It keeps saying: "It's going to be okay".
The country chants: "We're all together!",
It just sounds somewhat... trivial.

Some boys died a simple death,
Some boys died a horrible death. 
And not everyone was beautiful on the outside,
And not everyone was of great height.

          <p>The First Chechen War was a rebellion by the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria against the 
Russian Federation, fought from December 1994 to August 1996. 

This song is about the immediate participants of the First Chechen War ‚Äî russian
soldiers, especially young ones (as young as 18) drafted into the army and sent
straight to war. It also touches on how they were treated during and after the 
war as veterans. 

After watching the news of the Grozny (Chechnya capital) assault 
at the New Year's Eve ‚Äî 31st December 1994, Yuri Shevchuk (DDT lead singer) 
went to Grozny to see everything for himself. He also took his video camera with
him and recorded what he saw. He interviewed many soldiers and officers alike
about their take of the events, who were often bitter and perplexed at the 
actions of Russian officials which (according to them) were a cause for too many 
unnecessary deaths.

At the beginning of this video he goes out to a group of russian soldiers
and asks them where they're from so he can remember them. The replies are diverse: 
"Zelenogorsk (Tatarstan), Volgograd, Kalininrgad, Tula, Petersburg, Orenburg, Ural... " 
As it turned out only 1 out of 20 soldiers filmed in the video survived the war.

At about 0:42 Shevchuk says to the audience: "Would you stop clapping?"

If you wish to see more about Shevchuk in Chechnya search for "–®–µ–≤—á—É–∫ –≤ –ß–µ—á–Ω–µ"
