Gospel

Keen-sighted windows...
Who'll warm the keen-sighted windows?
Take pity on your pewter Christ 
With silent words!

Greedy fingers...
Who'll feed the greedy fingers?
Hug your non salvated Christ
With hungry arms!

Fugitive shadows...
Who'll catch the fugitive shadows?
Swaddle your hopeless Christ
With secure chains!

Slippery veins...
Anxious slippery veins!
Kiss your looking-glass Christ
With cold lips!

Round sky...
Who'll punish the round sky?
Strangle your unruly Christ
With obedient hands!
