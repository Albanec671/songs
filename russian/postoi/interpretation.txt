Won't the locomotive stop

Won't the locomotive stop, won't the wheels stop knocking,
Hit the brakes, conductor.
I am in a hurry to bow down for one last time
Before my dear mommy's eyes.

Don't you expect your good son home, mother.
Your son is not the same he was yesterday.
A dangerous bog has sucked me under,
And this life of mine is an eternal gamble.

Won't the locomotive stop, won't the wheels stop knocking.
There is still time to face the fate.
It's not too late to make a stop yet,
Hit the brakes, conductor!
