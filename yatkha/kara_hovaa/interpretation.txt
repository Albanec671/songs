Karangailyg Kara Hovaa

In the endless black steppe
Brown runner horse is running like a lightning
The black hair of my beautiful girl
Is moving in the wind

In the sunset light of the steppe
The black horse can run like a lightning
The long hairs of my sweet girl
Is moving in the wind

In the endless black steppe
Brown runner horse is running like a lightning
The black hair of my beautiful girl
Is moving in the wind
