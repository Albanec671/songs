The clouds flew

The clouds flew,
Far away they flew,
Like a mother's palm,
Like a father's trikot,

Fish-like ships,
Like foolish thoughts,
Above earthly windows,
The clouds flew.

Church domes flew,
Roads and flowers,
Ringing the bells,
Carefree like you,

Like drops of milk,
Like "hello" and "farewell",
Like an unfinished tea,
The clouds flew.

Bricks flew,
Soldiers of ancient walls,
Bohemians and outcasts.
Dragons of change,

Not the terrible War,
Not the bitter spirit,
This sorrowful country,
And your window is in it.

Flew by leisurely,
Fluttered in negligee,
Like a youthful soul,
In a burnt-out burqa,

For the Dao and Bethlehem,
To the edge of the earth,
Away from silly theorems,
Left in the dust.

I'll light my kitchen up,
From the century-chest,
Where the wings looked for a rider
For so long

I'll take them and lay out flat, 
Straighten them on my back,
To launch the spring
And the clouds within me.
