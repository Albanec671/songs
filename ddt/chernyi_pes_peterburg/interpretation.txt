Black hound Petersburg

Black hound Petersburg — muzzle on paws,
Ice cold eyes freezing through dust.
I am inhaling your stony scent tonight
Drinking street names, house-chains.

Black hound Petersburg — birdly horror of passers-by,
Stuffed in the windows of street lights.
Sounds like wolves are howling at Volkovsky street,
Tomorrow there's gonna be even more fun

That beast is never in a hurry.
That night never calls anybody to anyone.

Black hound Petersburg — I hear your voice
In dead hallways, in wheezing of locks
Like hair your music notes are all over the place
Drops of blood on stale rubles of old men

Black hound Petersburg — roofs and sofas,
And the emptiness above roofs gone.
Glasses in hallways are filled with ashes
Purity dwells here amidst the unbearable filth.

That beast is never in a hurry.
That night never calls anybody to anyone.

Black hound Petersburg — scattered gunpowder
Secrets of these walls, silent as graves
Strange rustle breathing at night in every corner
Any monument here is constantly at war

Black hound Petersburg — time gathered up in the moon
And your old master kicked the bucket.
You two are keeping silent, recalling a different 
Distribution of waves on Neva.

Black hound Petersburg — night is moored at the quay.
I can't win back my fate, my journey is due.
This dark water reflects the beginning
That I see, and like him, don't want to die.

Black hound Petersbourg — is there anything living
In this kingdom of walls smeared all over with time?
You're silent and always in a state of tranquility
Even under the weight of most abrupt turns 

That beast is never in a hurry.
That night never calls anybody to anyone.

Only me! Only you! Only me! Only you! Only heart!
Only heart lives on!

That Beast!!!
That Night!!!

Only me! Only you! Me! You! Me! You!
Heart! Our heart lives on! Our heart lives on!
